# DCRA-R - FAIR

Copyright Â© 2019 Stichting DICA. All rights reserved.

The Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL) defines a FAIR data
initiative (see: https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data). FAIR stands for
*F*indable *A*ccesible *I*nteroperable *R*eusable data. This
repository defines the metadata to insure metadata availability,
versioning and interoperability of the DCRA-R data.

## License
See `./LICENSE` for our licensing information.

## Version
The current version of the metadata is based on DCRAR version 1.0.1

## R2RML
A full interoperable overview of the data in DCRAR can be found in the
R2RML in this folder. This is a .ttl file which can be opened using
GraphDB. GraphDB can be downloaded from http://graphdb.ontotext.com/

## ROO
The Radiation Oncology Ontology (ROO) aims to cover the radiation
oncology domain with a strong focus on re-using existing
ontologies. The DCRAR metadata is uses the ROO as the primary ontology
to create interoperable data. More information about the ROO can be
found here: https://www.cancerdata.org/roo-information

## Data Dictionary
The R2RML is a condensed version of the full datadictionary to make
the DCRAR interoperable. The full datadictionary, which includes
information on data type, length and conditions, can be downloaded
from https://documents.mrdm.nl/showcase/downloaden
