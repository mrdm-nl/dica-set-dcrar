# Dutch ColoRectal Audit (DCRA)

The Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing (DICA) defines the Dutch
ColoRectalAudit (see: https://dica.nl/dcra/home). 

## DCRA-R
This repository supplies meta-data and data-dictionaries for the
radiotherapy part of the DCRA: called the DCRA-R.

## FAIR data
The Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL) defines a FAIR data
initiative (see: https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data). To provide limited
access to the DCRA-R as a FAIR data-resource, metadata has been
defined for this registration. Information about this metadata and the
schemas itself are available in hte `./FAIR` folder. See the
`./FAIR/README.md` for more information.
